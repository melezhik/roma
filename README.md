This project consists of making a 'choose your own adventure' story/game that executes in the console.
The students can use whatever methods necessary to make their console program work, but we need to at least see functions, if/else, and logging (logfile) capabilities. If the students want to go beyond that and dive into OOP or printing the logs to a CSV, that's also great.
